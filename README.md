# From One to Many: Writing Julia Code to Simulate Big Quantum Systems on Big Computers

In this workshop we're going to try to write some Julia code to simulate quantum systems in a
pleasant, efficient way. What you will need:

- A cloned copy of this repo
- 3-6 CPUs - you can use [JuliaBox](http://dev.juliabox.com/), your own laptop, or a cluster you have access to
- Julia 0.6
- If you're using your own computer, the Julia packages [`GR.jl`](https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl) and [`HDF5.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaIO/HDF5.jl).
