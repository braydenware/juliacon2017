    "We haven't used any of Julia's lovely [sophisticated type system](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/types.html). Let's fix that now. I will show some code and there are undoubtedly *many* possible improvements, which we'll leave (for now) as an **exercise**. If you want, believe that I'm leaving things simple for clarity, rather than because I'm a simple person.\n",
